Project Overview
This project aims to predict depression based on a set of features including education, gender, race, marital status, family size, age, and other related attributes. The machine learning model used is a Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

Features
User Inputs: The user inputs 27 features related to personal, demographic, and social factors.
Prediction: The app processes these inputs and provides a prediction based on the trained model.
Handles Missing Data: Imputes or handles missing data using various strategies.
Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework used to build the application.
scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning model training and prediction.
pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
HTML/CSS: For front-end web page rendering.

Usage
Open the app in your web browser.
Fill in the required 27 features in the form (e.g., education, gender, race, family size, etc.).
Click the "Predict" button.
The result will show whether the user is likely to experience depression based on the provided inputs.
Data Preprocessing
The app preprocesses input data to ensure it is in a format suitable for the machine learning model:

Categorical variables (e.g., gender, education) are encoded to numerical values.
Missing values are handled using an imputer, replacing them with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median).
Model Training
The machine learning model used in this application is an SVC (Support Vector Classifier). The model was trained on a dataset with 27 features relevant to depression prediction. The training process includes:

Data preprocessing (encoding categorical features).
Feature scaling (if necessary).
Training the SVC model on the processed data.
